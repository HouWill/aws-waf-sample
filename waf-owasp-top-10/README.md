# waf-owasp-top-10
This example AWS CloudFormation template contains an AWS WAF web access control list (ACL) and condition types and rules that illustrate various mitigations against application flaws described in the OWASP Top 10. However, note that this template is designed only as a starting point and may not provide sufficient protection to every workload. You should customize the templateâ€™s rules for each workload. For more information, please review the [Use AWS WAF to Mitigate OWASP's Top 10 Web Application Vulnerabilities](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/aws-waf-owasp.pdf) whitepaper.
